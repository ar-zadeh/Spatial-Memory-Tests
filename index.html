        <span>Hello and welcome!</span></p><p><span>Welcome to our study, MazeWorld. We are analyzing the memory and visual search skills humans use while navigating between places in a unique and exciting virtual reality environment. In this study, you will be playing a game where you need to navigate from a starting point to your final destination through a maze of tiles with instructions on the wall.
            Please note that you will be navigating the maze twice. During the second round, the instructions will not be available to you. You will need to rely on your memory to recall the path you took during the first round to reach the destination.
            Before we dive in, you'll need to complete some preliminary tests. Let's get started!
            If you have any questions at any time, feel free to ask. Now, please try to follow the instructions and remember the path as we proceed.
