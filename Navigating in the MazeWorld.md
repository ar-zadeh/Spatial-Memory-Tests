# Navigating in the MazeWorld

Now we are into the main phase of the study which is the study of navigation and wayfinding in Virtual Reality (VR). You will play a game called MazeWorld. You will experience a unique and exciting virtual reality maze game. In this task, you will be challenged to navigate from your starting point to a destination through a set of tiles. As you move from one tile to another, you may encounter walls that will block your path. But don't worry, you will be provided with instructions on the fastest route to reach the destination.

Here's how to play the game. First, focus your gaze on the direction you want to move. Then, look down to see the tiles and lift your right hand slightly. To move to a neighboring tile, press and hold the "A" button. Wait until you see the trace and then release the key.

Here is a video demonstration of me playing the game:

Please note that you will be playing the game twice. During the second round, the instructions will not be available to you, and it will be up to your memory to recall the path you took during the first round.

Now, let's see how well your memory and visual search skills are affected by the color and shapes in this maze game. Get ready to have fun and challenge yourself!
